This is a [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io) extension for [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

This is a part of the following paper. Please [cite](#citation) it when you use this project. You will also cite [the original SAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) and [the MobileSAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14289).

## Install

Drag and drop [the extension file](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/v0.7.0/qupath-extension-sam-0.7.0.jar) to [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io) and restart it.

Since QuPath v0.5.0, you can install the extension from the extension manager dialog by specifying `Owner` and `Repository` as shown below.

If you are using QuPath v0.4.x, you need to install [the extension file for QuPath v0.4.x](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/v0.4.1/qupath-extension-sam-0.4.1.jar), which is now deprecated.

Please note that you need to set up the server following the instructions in the link below.

## Update

To update the `qupath-extension-sam`, follow the following instructions.

1. Open extensions directory from `Extensions` > `Installed extensions` > `Open extensions directory`
   ![](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/assets/open-extensions-directory.png)
2. Replace `qupath-extension-sam-x.y.z.jar` with [the latest version of the extension file](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/v0.7.0/qupath-extension-sam-0.7.0.jar). If you are using QuPath v0.4.x, you need to install [the extension file for QuPath v0.4.x](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/v0.4.1/qupath-extension-sam-0.4.1.jar), which is now deprecated.
3. Restart QuPath application.

Please note that you need to also update the [samapi](https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/tree/v0.5.0) server.  
To keep updated with the latest samapi server, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ksugar/samapi#update).

## Usage

### SAM prompt command

#### Rectangle (BBox) prompt

1. Select `Extensions` > `SAM` from the menu bar.
2. Select the `Prompt` tab in the `Segment Anyghing Model` dialog.
3. Select a rectangle tool by clicking the icon.
4. Add rectangles.
5. Select rectangles to process. (`Alt` + `Ctrl` + `A`: Select all annotation objects `Ctrl` or `âŒ˜` + left click: Select multiple objects)
6. Press the `Run for selected` button.
7. If you activate `Live mode`, SAM predicts a mask every time you add a rectangle.

#### Point prompt

1. Select `Extensions` > `SAM` from the menu bar.
2. Select the `Prompt` tab in the `Segment Anyghing Model` dialog.
2. Select a point tool by clicking the icon.
3. Add foreground points.

### Tips

If you select a class in `Auto set` in the Annotations tab, it is used for a new annotation generated by SAM.

## Updates

### v0.7.0
- Support 2D+T tracking and 3D segmentation with [SAM2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/) models, available with the [samapi](https://github.com/ksugar/samapi) server `v0.6.0` and above.

### v0.6.0
- Support [SAM2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/) models, available with the [samapi](https://github.com/ksugar/samapi) server `v0.5.0` and above.
- Use the current view for the encoder input in the rectangle mode.

### v0.5.0
- QuPath v0.5 support by [@Rylern](https://github.com/Rylern) and [@ksugar](https://github.com/ksugar) in [ksugar/samapi#12](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/pull/12)

### v0.4.1
- Properly send the checkpoint URL parameter
  - The checkpoint URL was not sent to the server.
- Add a catalog of SAM weights to README
- Add example scripts under [src/main/resources/scripts](src/main/resources/scripts)

### v0.4.0
- Support for registering SAM weights from URL. [ksugar/qupath-extension-sam#8](https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/issues/8) [ksugar/samapi#11](https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/pull/11) suggested and tested by [@constantinpape](https://github.com/constantinpape)
- Combine the `Prompt` and `Auto mask` dialogs into a single `Segment Anything Model` dialog.

### v0.3.0

- Support for both point and rectangle foreground prompts by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)
  - Ensure each new point is a distinct object while SAM is running (i.e. turn of 'Multipoint' mode)
  - Support line ROIs as a way of adding multiple points in a single object

  <img src="https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/releases/download/assets/qupath-sam-multipoint.gif" width="768">

  <img src="https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/releases/download/assets/qupath-sam-rectangle-prompt.gif" width="768">

- Support point background prompts by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)
  - Points with 'ignored*' classifications are passed to the model as background prompts
    (Sidenote: it seems a large number of background points harm the prediction... or I've done something wrong)

  <img src="https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/releases/download/assets/qupath-sam-multipoint-live.gif" width="768">

- Implement 'Live mode' and 'Run for selected' by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)
  - 'Live mode' toggle button to turn live detection on or off
  - Alternative 'Run for selected' button to use only the selected foreground and background objects
    - This makes it possible to annotate first, then run SAM across multiple objects - as required [on the forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/qupath-extension-segment-anything-model-sam/82420/10)

  <img src="https://github.com/ksugar/qupath-extension-sam/releases/download/assets/qupath-sam-point-prompt.gif" width="768">

- Support SamAutomaticMaskGenerator

  <img src="https://github.com/ksugar/samapi/releases/download/assets/qupath-sam-automask.gif" width="768">

- Menu items simplified to a single command to launch a dialog to control annotation with SAM by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)
  - Provide persistent preferences for key choices (e.g. server, model)
  - Run prediction in a background thread with (indeterminate) progress indicator
  - Help the user with tooltips (and prompts shown at the bottom of the dialog)

- Handle changing the current image while the command is running by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)
  - Send entire field of view for point prediction
    This is useful for one-click annotation of visible structures

- Include the 'quality' metric as a measurement for objects that are created by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)

- Support z-stacks/time series (by using the image plane; there's no support for 3D objects) by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead) and [@rharkes](https://github.com/rharkes)

- Optionally assign names & random colors to identify the generated objects by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)

- Optionally return multiple (3) detections instead of 1 by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)

- Select which detection to retain based upon size or quality, or keep all of them by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)

- Optionally keep the prompt objects, instead of immediately deleting them by [@petebankhead](https://github.com/petebankhead)

### v0.2.0

- Support any number of channels

I demonstrate that functional performance can be achieved even with sparsely annotated data. Furthermore, I show that the selection of sparse cell annotations significantly impacts performance. I modified Cellpose and StarDist to enable training with sparsely annotated data and evaluated them in conjunction with ELEPHANT, a cell tracking algorithm that internally uses U-Net based cell segmentation. These results illustrate that sparse annotation is a generally effective strategy in deep learning-based cell image segmentation. Finally, I demonstrate that with the help of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), it is feasible to build an effective deep learning model of cell image segmentation from scratch just in a few minutes.Competing Interest StatementKS is employed part-time by LPIXEL Inc.},
